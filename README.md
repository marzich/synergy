# Synergy <a href="https://www.sii.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=".github/assets/sii-logo.png" height="28" alt="Shanghai Innovation Institute" /></a>

Synergy is an open-source AI agent workspace for persistent, recoverable software and knowledge work. It is built by the [Holos](https://github.com/SII-Holos) team at Shanghai Innovation Institute (SII).

One Synergy runtime hosts sessions, agents, tools, knowledge, automation, and integrations. Web, Desktop, and CLI are clients of that runtime, so the same work can continue across interactive, background, and one-off flows.

Synergy works as a standalone local workspace. Connecting a Holos agent adds account identity, agent messaging, presence, and Synergy Link remote execution without replacing local projects, providers, sessions, or data.

Read the [product overview](docs/product/overview.md) for the complete product model.

## What You Can Do

- Keep durable sessions attached to an explicit home or project `Scope`.
- Use configurable primary agents and specialist subagents with built-in, MCP, and plugin tools.
- Plan work as durable Blueprints, execute them through independently reviewed BlueprintLoops, or use Light Loop for a focused task that should continue until verified.
- Organize larger goals as a Lattice Pathway of planned, executed, and reviewed steps.
- Schedule recurring or triggered work through Agenda.
- Retain reusable memory and learned experience in Library, while authoring Notes and Blueprints as separate documents.
- Browse project files through the Side Workspace file workbench with a virtualized Explorer, multi-file tabs, and source or preview modes.
- Work with the same session-owned Browser page from the UI and browser tools.
- Connect external messaging through Channels, mail through governed Email tools, and remote agents or hosts through Holos and Synergy Link.
- Use Clarus projects as standard Synergy Project Scopes and Sessions through the Channel system.
- Extend tools, agents, skills, commands, MCP servers, configuration, hooks, and product UI with plugins.

Long sessions use compaction to replace older model context with a continuation summary while preserving the complete durable session history.

## Quick Start

### Desktop

Download a platform installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SII-Holos/synergy/releases):

- macOS: `.pkg`
- Windows: NSIS `.exe`
- Linux: `.deb`

The recommended installers include the Desktop app and expose its packaged runtime as the `synergy` CLI. Portable artifacts are also published but do not configure a system CLI.

Released packages do not require Rust. Rust is used only to build the Linux and Windows sandbox helpers. The Linux `.deb` installs Bubblewrap as a package dependency; Linux portable and CLI archive users must install `bubblewrap` with their system package manager. Windows Desktop and CLI releases currently support x64.

### CLI and Web

Install the current release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SII-Holos/synergy/main/install | bash
```

Install a specific release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SII-Holos/synergy/main/install | bash -s -- --version <version>
```

The CLI installer places the runtime, Web UI, and schema assets under `~/.synergy/`. It does not install the Electron Desktop app.

Desktop Browser presentation includes Electron's Chromium. Headless Browser tools used directly by the CLI/server require an installed Chrome or Chromium; set `CHROMIUM_PATH` when it is not in a standard system or Playwright cache location.

Configure a model provider, start the background runtime, and open the Web client:

```bash
synergy config wizard
synergy start
synergy web
```

Run one task from the terminal:

```bash
synergy send "summarize this repository"
```

Useful runtime commands:

```bash
synergy status
synergy logs
synergy doctor
synergy stop
```

Run `synergy server` for a foreground server. `synergy web --attach <url>` and `synergy send --attach <url> ...` connect to a non-default runtime.

Holos is optional. Connect an agent from the Web account surface or with:

```bash
synergy holos login
```

See the [CLI reference](docs/reference/cli.md) and [configuration reference](docs/reference/configuration.md) for the complete command and configuration models.

## Develop Synergy

Synergy is a Bun monorepo using TypeScript ESM modules. The pinned package manager is declared in [`package.json`](package.json).

Prepare a source checkout:

```bash
bun dev prepare
```

Common development flows:

```bash
bun dev server
bun dev app --open
bun dev web
bun dev desktop
bun dev desktop --managed
bun dev send "your message"
```

Default local preflight:

```bash
bun run quality:quick
```

Core runtime tests run from `packages/synergy`:

```bash
cd packages/synergy
bun test
bun run test:ci # CI-equivalent sequential shards
```

Frontend package suites run through their standard scripts and are included in `bun run quality`:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app test
bun run --cwd packages/ui test
```

Frontend product copy is extracted into English and Simplified Chinese catalogs, plus a development-only pseudo catalog. Changes to visible text or locale formatting also run:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app i18n:extract
bun run localization:check
```

When developing Synergy while using Synergy itself, start an isolated second instance with a separate `SYNERGY_HOME` and explicit ports. Never stop or replace the instance hosting your active session. The [development reference](docs/reference/development.md) contains the complete workflow.

## Develop Plugins

Plugin authors can start without cloning this repository:

```bash
bunx @ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin-kit create my-plugin --template tool-ui
cd my-plugin
bun install
synergy-plugin build
synergy-plugin validate --runtime-discovery
```

Start with the [plugin documentation](docs/plugins/README.md) and the [`@ericsanchezok/synergy-plugin` API reference](packages/plugin/README.md).

## Documentation

The [documentation home](docs/README.md) routes readers by product area and task.

- [Product overview](docs/product/overview.md) — product purpose, objects, workflows, and boundaries
- [Architecture](docs/architecture/README.md) — runtime invariants and implementation ownership
- [CLI reference](docs/reference/cli.md) — installed and source-checkout commands
- [Configuration reference](docs/reference/configuration.md) — domains, precedence, providers, and instructions
- [Storage and paths](docs/reference/storage-and-paths.md) — persistent state and workspace layout
- [Plugin documentation](docs/plugins/README.md) — definitions, generated artifacts, capabilities, runtime, UI, and publishing
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) — repository setup and pull request workflow

Coding agents and LLM tools should begin with [llms.txt](llms.txt). Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) only when modifying the Synergy repository; plugin authors do not need the repository agent guide.
