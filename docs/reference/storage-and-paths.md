# Storage and Paths

Synergy keeps installation state under one root:

```text
<SYNERGY_HOME or OS home>/.synergy/
```

`SYNERGY_HOME` changes the parent home, not the `.synergy` suffix. For example, `SYNERGY_HOME=/tmp/example` produces `/tmp/example/.synergy/`.

## Top-Level Layout

| Path      | Responsibility                                                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bin/`    | installed launchers and binaries                                       |
| `config/` | global domain config, global agents/commands/skills, instruction files |
| `data/`   | durable product data and auth stores                                   |
| `log/`    | normal process logs                                                    |
| `state/`  | daemon, runtime, trace, and process state                              |
| `cache/`  | disposable model/provider/marketplace and derived caches               |
| `schema/` | installed JSON schemas                                                 |

Cache version changes can clear `cache/` on startup. Treat cache as reproducible, not as a backup source.

## JSON Storage

Most durable product objects use file-based JSON storage rooted at `data/`. A logical storage key maps to nested directories plus a `.json` suffix. Writes take per-file locks and use a temporary file followed by atomic rename. Streaming message/part writes can use compact JSON; lower-frequency records remain indented.

Major collections include:

```text
data/projects/
data/session_index/
data/sessions_page_index/
data/session_child_index/
data/session_nav_v2/
data/sessions/<scope>/<session>/
data/session_message_order_v1/<scope>/<session>/
data/endpoint_session/
data/channel/project_scopes/
data/channel/workspaces/
data/channel/providers/clarus/accounts/
data/permissions/
data/permission-rules.json
data/notes/<scope>/
data/agenda/items/<scope>/
data/agenda/runs/<scope>/<item>/
data/blueprint_loops/<scope>/
data/superplan/runs/<scope>/
data/superplan/events/<scope>/<run>/
data/lattice/runs/<scope>/
data/lattice/events/<scope>/
data/holos/contacts/
data/holos/mailbox/
data/synergy_link/targets/
data/stats/
data/github/deliveries/
data/github/ci/
data/github/runtime.json
data/github/poll-state/
```

GitHub integration deliveries, CI failure state, runtime anchors, and per-repository poll state live under `data/github/`. Each delivery is keyed by its synthetic delivery GUID. Poll state files use URI-encoded repository names.

Synergy Link targets live under `data/synergy_link/targets/`, one JSON record per stable target ID. They contain routing identifiers, local visibility policy, authorization state, and last observed host capabilities. Holos account secrets remain in `data/auth/` and are never copied into target records.

Inside a session, `info.json`, `summary.json`, `summary_cursor.json`, `todo.json`, `dag.json`, `inbox/`, `messages/`, and `history/` are separate records. The summary cursor is derived, discardable state used to extend cumulative diff ranges from bounded loop messages; missing cursors rebuild from session history, and rollback or unrollback invalidates them. Message info and each part are independently addressable, which supports streaming writes and narrow reads.

The session index, paged-session index, child-session index, navigation index, and message-order index are derived but operationally important. `session_message_order_v1` contains sortable per-message markers and a readiness/count record for bounded newest-first reads; missing or interrupted state rebuilds from canonical message info. Do not hand-move one session directory without its Scope/session indexes; use export/import, data, migration, or repair workflows.

## Library Database

Library uses:

```text
data/library.db
```

It is a Bun SQLite database with WAL behavior and optional `sqlite-vec` tables for Memory and Experience embeddings. It is installation-global while records retain Scope/session metadata. SQLite sidecar files can exist while the server is active; copy the database only through a consistent backup workflow.

## Credentials

Credential files live under `data/auth/`, including:

- `api-key.json` and `provider-auth.json`
- `holos-accounts.json`
- `mcp.json`
- integration-specific auth stores

Holos account storage is permissioned to the local user. Treat the entire auth directory as sensitive. Diagnostics and SmartAllow use redaction/metadata paths rather than exposing raw secrets.

Plugin-scoped credentials live separately at `data/plugin/<plugin-id>/auth.json`. Plugin approvals, audit history, runtime health, and the local registry use `data/plugin-approvals.json`, `data/plugin-audit.json`, `data/plugin-runtime-state.json`, and `data/registry/plugins.json`; `plugin.lock` at the installation root binds installed specs to resolved artifacts and integrity. Treat plugin auth and signing material under `keys/` as sensitive even when the plugin itself is trusted.

## Browser, Worktrees, and Artifacts

| Path                      | Content                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data/browser/sessions/`  | canonical Browser session/page metadata                    |
| `data/browser/profiles/`  | persistent browser profiles and storage state              |
| `data/browser/uploads/`   | owner-scoped upload staging                                |
| `data/browser/downloads/` | browser downloads grouped by Scope                         |
| `data/browser/chromium/`  | managed Chromium assets                                    |
| `data/worktree/`          | Synergy-managed worktree metadata/resources                |
| `data/snapshot/`          | file snapshots used by history/file restoration            |
| `data/tool-output/`       | large tool outputs externalized from message records       |
| `data/assets/`            | product/plugin assets                                      |
| `data/media/`             | generated or captured media, including Browser screenshots |

Archiving or deleting a session disposes its live Browser runtime, but persisted Browser state follows its own lifecycle and migration rules.

## Daemon and Observability State

Managed service state is under:

```text
state/daemon/manifest.json
state/daemon/runtime-lock.json
state/daemon/logs/server.log
```

The lock records PID, server/daemon mode, command, and working directory. A stale or conflicting lock is inspected rather than blindly overwritten.

Platform service definitions live in platform-owned locations:

- macOS: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.synergy.server.plist`
- Linux: `~/.config/systemd/user/synergy.service`
- Windows: Task Scheduler plus launch scripts in `state/daemon/`

Structured observability traces live under `state/observability/traces/`. Performance and diagnostics state may add adjacent state/data records. `synergy status --verbose`, `synergy logs`, and `synergy diagnostics` are the supported inspection entry points.

Indexed observability telemetry lives in `state/observability/observability.sqlite`. The database uses WAL plus incremental auto-vacuum. Retention and size maintenance evict the globally oldest eligible historical telemetry in bounded batches while preserving running spans and open issues. Existing observability databases and the previous `state/observability/performance/performance.sqlite` store are upgraded through central, transactional observability migrations; runtime request paths do not perform schema upgrades or full-database vacuum operations.

Plugin installation stages artifacts and holds its transaction lock under `state/plugin-install/`. Cached plugin packages, extracted archives, marketplace records, models, provider catalogs, and downloaded runtime dependencies live under `cache/`; they may be recreated and must not be treated as approval or credential records. LSP process bookkeeping is kept in `state/lsp-pids.json`.

## Project-Local `.synergy`

A repository's `.synergy/` is project configuration and extension source, not the installation data root:

```text
<project>/.synergy/synergy.d/
<project>/.synergy/agent/
<project>/.synergy/command/
<project>/.synergy/skill/
```

Project worktrees may also be managed beneath a project-local Synergy area. Permission policy treats the active worktree as the write/execute boundary and the original checkout as readable but protected from autonomous modification.

## Relocation and Backup

Stop the server before raw filesystem backup or relocation. For supported selective movement, use `synergy data pack`, `merge`, `move`, and `set-home`. Use session export/import for portable session artifacts.

Never include `data/auth/` in a public diagnostics bundle, issue attachment, or repository commit.
