# Cortex Delegation

Cortex is Synergy's child-session execution layer. It turns a delegated unit of work into a separately observable session with its own prompt, agent, model, progress, output contract, cancellation tree, and optional worktree.

Delegation is implemented as a tree of sessions, rather than as hidden work inside one message history. A parent session assigns a bounded task, Cortex creates or reuses a child session to perform it, and the child returns an explicit result while keeping its own history.

## Task and Session Identity

A Cortex task records:

- its task ID and child session ID
- the parent session and parent message that launched it
- a description and full prompt
- the selected agent, execution role, category, and optional DAG node
- status and live progress
- visibility, durable parent-notification intent, and optional delivery timestamp
- output mode and resolved output

Task status moves through `queued`, `running`, and one terminal state: `completed`, `error`, `cancelled`, or `interrupted`. A Task is created only when it has entered the Cortex queue, so there is no separate `pending` lifecycle state. `interrupted` means durable metadata says work was active, but no live runtime survived restart; it is distinct from an execution error.

The child session is the durable record. The in-memory task entry coordinates live execution and is eventually evicted; the child session retains its Cortex metadata, messages, model, terminal status, output, `notifyParentOnComplete` decision, and optional `deliveryNotifiedAt` timestamp.

Plugin-owned tasks additionally persist plugin ID, plugin generation, Scope ID, and a plugin-defined correlation ID. These fields let a plugin resume its own domain workflow without treating the in-memory Cortex map as durable state.

The Plugin Task Host can resolve the task that owns the current invocation directly from this durable child-Session metadata. Ownership is committed before child execution begins, so an internal plugin tool can bind through the correlation ID even before the original `start()` call has returned to the plugin.

## Launch and Concurrency

Synergy has one Cortex launch mechanism and two authorization entry paths:

- Model-directed delegation through the native `task` tool requires a non-hidden subagent that is visible to the caller and permitted by its delegation policy. The same predicate determines which Agents appear in the caller's prompt.
- Host-owned workflows may programmatically launch a private hidden subagent after their owning subsystem establishes authorization. Built-in workflows own their internal Agents. A plugin owns only the Agent contributions resolved from that same plugin generation, and its approved `task.delegate` allowlist must include the target.

Both paths enter `Cortex.launch()` and create the same Task and child Session. Plugins do not get a second Agent registry, task scheduler, transcript store, or execution loop.

Cortex creates a child session in the parent's `Scope` and workspace, or reuses an idle compatible child when reuse is requested. If a new worktree is requested, Cortex creates one for the child; a child of an existing worktree inherits that worktree instead of nesting another.

Tasks are admitted through both per-agent and process-global concurrency limits. Each concurrency key allows at most eight running tasks. The global maximum defaults to eight and can be set with the global `cortex.maxConcurrentTasks` configuration or overridden for the process by `SYNERGY_CORTEX_GLOBAL_CONCURRENCY`. Lowering the maximum does not cancel running tasks; it queues new work until capacity is available, while raising it wakes eligible queued work.

Memory pressure applies a process-wide safety maximum of four under elevated pressure or two under critical pressure. ArrayBuffer pressure enters those states at 1 GiB and 2 GiB respectively, before the session GC thresholds at which Bun stream allocations may already fail. The configured, environment-provided, or default value remains the desired maximum; the scheduler uses the lower of that value and the active memory-pressure limit. Lowering the effective limit never cancels running work. The read-only `cortex.concurrency` API reports configured, environment, effective, memory-pressure limit and reason, source, per-agent, running, and queued values.

An explicit task model wins. Otherwise Cortex resolves the selected agent's available model, with the parent's model available as the normal fallback path. The resolved model is persisted on the child session.

The launcher can pass `maxOutputTokens` to cap the child session's model output and `maxCost` to discard task output when final measured usage exceeds a cost ceiling. `maxOutputTokens` is passed through to `SessionInvoke.invokeInternal()` for both the initial call and any structured-output repair turns; `maxCost` is checked before Cortex publishes terminal output. The GitHub shadow proposer uses both fields to enforce its proposal budget. When either field is absent, that per-task limit is not applied.

## Execution Roles and Tool Boundaries

The ordinary role is `delegated_subagent`. It is intentionally narrower than a primary session:

- permission questions are denied rather than routed back interactively
- task delegation and task inspection tools are removed
- DAG mutation tools are removed
- configured primary-only tools are removed
- deferred tool discovery and expansion remain available, but they expose only tools already allowed by the selected agent's permission rules

This keeps a delegated task bounded and prevents accidental recursive orchestration. Hidden internal reviewers can be given an explicit `delegationGroup` so they can call selected specialists while remaining hidden and unavailable as direct user targets.

The child still uses the normal session loop, control-profile resolution, capability gate, permission rules, and sandbox pipeline.

## Foreground and Background Tasks

A background task returns its identity immediately and continues independently. A foreground task waits for the child result for up to 300 seconds. If the wait expires, the task keeps running in the background rather than being cancelled.

Completion uses a two-phase protocol (see "Two-Phase Completion Protocol" below). When a synchronous waiter exists, Cortex resolves that waiter directly and durably suppresses the parent notification. Otherwise, an eligible visible task writes one lightweight `steer` item to the parent's persistent Inbox with a stable task-derived delivery key, then requests `SessionDrive` to process it. The notification does NOT contain the final result — it tells the parent to retrieve it once with `task_output(mode="full")`. Hidden reviewer tasks normally suppress parent-facing task events and notifications.

When the parent explicitly reads a terminal task through `task_output(mode="full")` (or the default mode), `afterPersist` calls `acknowledgeParentCompletion()`, which disables future notification recovery and removes the still-pending Inbox item. Diagnostic modes (`progress`, `tail`, `summary`) do **not** acknowledge completion; the notification persists until the parent retrieves the full result.

## Progress

Cortex observes the child session while it runs. Progress includes:

- the latest textual activity
- current and recent tool calls with their states
- elapsed time and update time

Recent tool history is bounded, and progress events are throttled to avoid turning streaming activity into excessive durable or frontend updates. Progress is observability, not a separate execution log; the child message history remains authoritative.

## Output Contracts

The launcher selects one of three output modes:

- `summary` — the default; returns a compact trajectory summary for internal agents, or bounded assistant text for external agents
- `final_response` — returns the final assistant response without trajectory summarization
- `structured` — requires a JSON Schema object and returns validated structured data

Structured output is implemented through an ephemeral result tool and JSON Schema validation. The caller can permit zero to three repair turns when a result does not validate. External agents do not support structured Cortex output.

Large external-agent outputs are bounded while preserving useful head and tail content. Output normalization is part of task completion and is stored with the child session.

## Two-Phase Completion Protocol

Automatic completion is a two-phase protocol: **notification** and **result retrieval**.

**Phase 1 — Notification**: When a background task reaches a terminal state and no synchronous waiter exists, Cortex writes one lightweight `steer` Inbox item to the parent session. The notification identifies the task and its outcome but does **not** contain the final result. The message instructs the parent to retrieve the result once with `task_output(task_id="...", mode="full")`. The notification is persisted idempotently with a stable task-derived delivery key, so a crash or restart before the parent reads it causes the notification to be re-requested rather than lost.

**Phase 2 — Result retrieval and acknowledgement**: The parent reads the final result with `task_output(mode="full")` (or the default mode). This persisted read acknowledges the task completion: Cortex calls `acknowledgeParentCompletion()`, which sets `notifyParentOnComplete` to `false` on both the in-memory task entry and the durable child session, and removes the pending Inbox item. Future notification recovery is disabled for this task.

**Diagnostic reads preserve notification**: Modes `progress`, `tail`, and `summary` are one-shot snapshots for live status inspection. They do **not** call `acknowledgeParentCompletion()`, do not clear the Inbox item, and do not suppress future notifications. The notification persists until the parent explicitly retrieves the full result. This prevents a diagnostic poll from silently consuming the wake-up.

**block=true is full-only**: The `block` parameter is valid only with `mode="full"` or the default mode. Diagnostic modes with `block=true` are rejected at the Zod schema level.

**Foreground path**: A synchronous waiter (foreground `task()` or `task_output` with `block=true`) receives the result directly through `Cortex.waitFor()`. When a synchronous waiter exists, parent notification is durably suppressed (`notifyParentOnComplete = false`), making delivery and acknowledgement mutually exclusive per task.

**Durable output after eviction**: The in-memory task entry is eventually compacted and evicted, but the child session remains the durable record. After eviction, `task_output(mode="full")` can still retrieve terminal output from the child session's persisted Cortex metadata, including its `output` field and terminal `status`. This means the parent can retrieve a task's result even after the live task handle has been removed.

## Delivery to the Parent

Parent delivery and child persistence are separate:

1. the child session reaches a terminal state
2. Cortex resolves and persists the configured output and notification intent
3. a foreground waiter receives it directly, or an eligible parent notification is persisted idempotently in the parent Inbox
4. `SessionDrive` processes runnable parent Inbox work when the parent is idle
5. a linked DAG node is updated and may be auto-promoted
6. temporary child-worktree resources are cleaned up when appropriate

A running parent is not interrupted with another model call in the middle of its turn. Its completion notice may already be durable in the Inbox; releasing the active session lease asks the shared drive to process that item before any workflow continuation proposal. Callers that need a direct result should await the task, while orchestration features can bind the task to a DAG node.

At Synergy startup, durable child sessions left in `queued` or `running` state are changed to `interrupted` and emit the same observer so plugin control planes can make an explicit recovery decision. Cortex then reconciles eligible terminal notifications from child-session state: a missing delivery is restored with the stable key, while an already persisted but unprocessed Inbox item only re-requests the parent drive. Hidden tasks and old or explicitly suppressed records whose notification intent is not `true` are not recovered.

Plugin Host delegation is always handle-based: `start()` returns immediately, while `get()` and the `cortex.task.after` observer expose completion.

## Cancellation and Retention

Cancelling a task traverses its descendant task tree, aborts active work, releases concurrency slots, records terminal state, and cleans up owned worktree resources. Cancellation does not erase the child session.

Visible terminal tasks keep their live task record long enough for clients to observe completion, then the in-memory entry is removed. The durable child session remains available through normal session navigation and inspection.

## Invariants

- Delegation creates a child session; it does not splice child messages into the parent history.
- Hidden Agents stay out of model prompts and native `task` targets; host-owned invocation does not make them visible.
- Plugin-owned private Agents are resolved and authorized by plugin ID plus generation before entering the ordinary Cortex path.
- Parent and child retain an explicit hierarchy through `parentID` and Cortex metadata.
- An ordinary delegated subagent cannot recursively delegate or ask the user for permission.
- Tool expansion changes child-session exposure only; it never grants a deferred tool denied by agent or session permissions.
- Backgrounding changes who waits; it does not change the task's execution or persistence.
- Output mode is an explicit contract, not a best-effort prompt convention.
- Cancellation covers descendant tasks and runtime resources without deleting durable history.
- Parent completion notification is durable and idempotent; acknowledgement and delivery are mutually exclusive per task.
