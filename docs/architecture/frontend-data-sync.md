# Frontend Data Sync

## Purpose

The Web application maintains reactive projections of server-owned state. Initial and explicit loads come from generated SDK requests; ongoing changes arrive through one global event connection and are routed into global or Scope-local stores.

The sync layer optimizes identity stability, reconnect recovery, streaming cost, and bounded memory. It is not a complete normalized entity database: some feature resources remain component-owned and must refetch after reconnect.

## Connection Model

`GlobalSDKProvider` opens one WebSocket to:

```text
/global/event/ws?stream=delta
```

The server sends envelopes containing:

```ts
{
  directory: string
  payload: Event
}
```

`directory` routes the event to the home, project, or global emitter. A session executing in a worktree still emits to the directory of its owning Scope, not to a second store for the worktree path.

The connection:

- pings every 20 seconds;
- waits 10 seconds for a pong;
- closes after three missed pongs;
- reconnects with jittered exponential delay from 1 to 30 seconds;
- ignores server heartbeat frames as transport liveness only.

Incoming events are batched on an approximately 16 ms cadence. Replaceable high-frequency state such as session status, inbox snapshots, LSP state, and full part updates is coalesced by identity before the Solid batch is applied.

## Store Shape

The sync layer has:

- one global store for paths, project list, providers, provider auth, and global Agenda data;
- one lazily created store per home/project Scope;
- message arrays keyed by session ID (window, not full transcript);
- `messageWindow` metadata keyed by session ID (cursor, hasMore, total, mode, pendingLatest);
- `latestContextMessage` keyed by session ID, holding the latest eligible assistant snapshot independently of the visible message window;
- part arrays keyed by message ID;
- per-session buckets for status, diffs, todo, DAG, inbox, permissions, questions, and Plan Blueprint offers;
- per-Scope collections for sessions, agents, commands, config, MCP, LSP, VCS, Cortex, and Agenda.

**Diff data sources.** Two separate diff stores exist:

- **Turn-level diffs** are stored in `message[n].summary.diffs` on the user message and reach the frontend through the existing `message.updated` state event. No new event, store bucket, or route was needed — the normal message reconcile path carries them.
- **Session-level diffs** live in the `session_diff` bucket and aggregate all turn diffs for the Review workbench panel. They are loaded on demand through `sync.session.diff()` and never fetched implicitly.

Global bootstrap starts the health check and the global config/path/Scope/provider/auth requests concurrently. Scope bootstrap limits concurrent instance requests to two. Each instance uses the generated `scope.bootstrap()` snapshot to load required provider, agent, config, and Scope identity plus optional path, command, session status/list, MCP, Cortex, Agenda, and project LSP/VCS state. The snapshot is reconciled in one Solid batch before the store becomes `partial`; permissions and questions keep their independent owner routes, and the store becomes `complete` after those requests settle.

## Reconcile, Do Not Replace

Existing store objects and list entries are updated with Solid's `reconcile()`.

This is an invariant for event handlers and refetches:

- use a stable entity key such as `id` or `file` for collections;
- reconcile an existing session, message, part, permission, question, Agenda item, or other entity;
- use `produce()` only for insertion, removal, a narrow leaf mutation, or coordinated bucket deletion;
- do not replace a whole object merely because one event carries a complete serialized value.

Preserving unchanged identities keeps memos and components that read unrelated leaves from invalidating on every timestamp, status, or streaming update.

Streaming delta application is even narrower: it appends only to the `text` leaf of the matching text/reasoning part.

## Message Window and Cursor Pagination

The frontend maintains a per-session bounded message window backed by cursor-based pagination via `GET /session/:sessionID/message/page` (generated SDK `session.messagePage`). The unbounded `messages()` API and `/session/:sessionID/message` route remain available for runtime loops, export, and preview consumers.

### Window state

Each session stores `MessageWindowMetadata` keyed by session ID in the store:

```ts
type MessageWindowMetadata = {
  nextCursor: string | null
  hasMore: boolean
  total: number
  mode: "latest" | "history"
  pendingLatest: boolean
  pendingLatestIds: string[]
}
```

The `messages` array in the store contains only the visible window messages, not the full transcript.

### Page size and cap

- Frontend page loads use `limit: 200`; the store cap is 500.
- The store's `DEFAULT_CAP` of 500 applies to both latest loads and history prepends.

### Latest mode

Initial load and reconnect recovery use latest mode (`mode: "latest"`). Incoming `message.updated` events reconcile into the window:

- If the message already exists, the window updates in place.
- If the message is new and the window is in latest mode, it is inserted and the window is capped by dropping the oldest messages.
- Dropped message IDs release their part buckets from the store.

The window cursor (`nextCursor`) is recorded from each page response so older pages can be loaded later.

### Latest Context projection

Context status and workbench consumers read `sync.session.latestContextMessage(sessionID)` rather than deriving latest usage from the bounded `messages` viewport. The projection is owned by sync and has three states: a missing key (`undefined`) is uninitialized and permits a temporary fallback to an already-loaded eligible viewport message, `null` means an authoritative latest page contained no eligible assistant and forbids that fallback, and a message is the latest ordered context-usage record.

Eligible usage snapshots are assistant messages with `includeInContext !== false` and either structured `contextUsage` or a non-zero legacy input, output, or reasoning token total. A completed included compaction assistant is instead an ordered invalidation barrier: it sorts after pre-compaction usage but does not expose the compaction call's own tokens as conversation context usage. Consumers show usage as unknown until the next ordinary assistant snapshot. Canonical chronology is `time.created`, then `id`; a later ineligible zero-usage assistant does not erase an earlier eligible snapshot.

Every no-cursor latest page apply seeds the projection, including normal session loads, navigation prefetch, reconnect/recovery refreshes, return-to-latest, stale-cursor recovery, and compaction reloads. Cursor/history pages never replace it. Latest page loads and background prefetches capture a `message` resource request token before the request. A latest response may replace the visible window only if no newer message event, authoritative part checkpoint/removal, history prepend, or optimistic local message write invalidated that token while it was in flight. Background prefetches additionally run only when no message window exists, so they populate an initially empty bucket rather than displace a loaded conversation.

Latest-page loading treats a freshness rejection as a superseded attempt, not a successful empty apply. The session message loader retries once with new request tokens and reports the bucket ready only after an apply succeeds. Repeated supersession becomes a visible load error while preserving any previously successful snapshot.

Each asynchronous latest-page request also captures a per-session projection revision. A newer latest-page request or a persisted `message.updated`/`message.removed` event advances that revision. After resource freshness accepts a page, the projection revision independently prevents an older response from overwriting newer event-driven Context usage. Complete persisted `message.updated` events reduce the projection inside the accepted event write even while history mode suppresses insertion into `messages`. Removing the projected message invalidates the key without a per-event request; the next authoritative latest page restores it.

### History mode

When the user requests older messages via "Load earlier", the frontend switches to history mode (`mode: "history"`):

- The existing window messages are preserved; older fetched messages are prepended.
- The combined set is capped at 500 by dropping the newest overflow (not the just-loaded older messages).
- A subsequent `message.updated` event for a message not already in the window sets `pendingLatest: true` instead of inserting it. The metadata retains the exact unseen IDs in `pendingLatestIds`, so duplicate updates do not add state and a matching `message.removed` clears only that notice without decrementing the window total for a message it never counted.
- `total` excludes those suppressed live arrivals while history mode remains active. Older-page totals are reduced by the count of remaining `pendingLatestIds` so suppressed live arrivals do not inflate the displayed total; returning to latest replaces the metadata with the server total and clears the pending IDs.

History page responses are intentionally applied without snapshot-version ordering because they extend the existing window rather than replace it. Applying a history page invalidates the `message` resource revision so a concurrent latest-page response cannot subsequently overwrite the prepended window.

### Return to latest

"Return to latest" refetches `messagePage()` without a cursor, resetting `mode` to `"latest"` and clearing `pendingLatest`. The UI force-scrolls to the bottom. Stale-cursor errors during `loadMore` also automatically trigger this recovery: the frontend catches `SessionMessagePageCursorStaleError` and refetches latest.

### Scroll anchor

Successful prepend in history mode captures the DOM offset of the first visible message before the fetch and restores it afterward, keeping the visible conversation stable. The session page's `turnStart`, which controls how many user turns are visible in the scroller, is reset to 0 only after a successful load so failed loads do not disturb the turn pagination state.

## Initial and Explicit Loads

The generated SDK owns internal HTTP calls. Scope-specific clients carry home `scopeID` or project directory context.

Scope initialization uses `GET /scope/bootstrap` (`scope.bootstrap()`). The server reads the aggregated fields concurrently. Provider, agent, and config are required; failure in any of them fails the request. Optional field failures keep the response usable and are reported by field in `_errors`. Home snapshots omit project-only LSP and VCS fields.

Session detail loading is split by concern:

- session metadata loads independently;
- messages load through `session.messagePage()` in page size 200, stored in a bounded window capped at 500;
- parts are sorted and reconciled under their owning message;
- inbox, todo, and DAG refresh together through `session.volatileBatch()`, while diff, permissions, and questions retain separate refresh paths.

`POST /session/batch/volatile` accepts at most 50 deduplicated session IDs and returns an in-band state or error for each requested session. Missing, archived, and cross-Scope sessions do not expose state. After reconnect resync, the client invalidates volatile freshness for every retained session, clears inactive cached inbox/todo/DAG buckets, and batch-refreshes only the actively viewed session. An inactive session reloads through its normal detail path when viewed instead of being eagerly fetched during reconnect.

Frontend code should not introduce raw `fetch()` for ordinary Synergy routes. Add route OpenAPI metadata, regenerate the SDK, and use the generated client. Streams, browser-native file/blob flows, and external URLs remain valid raw transport cases.

## State Event Sequencing

Each Scope runtime owns a fresh event `epoch` and a monotonic `seq` counter.

- Every non-streaming Bus event receives the current epoch and next contiguous sequence number.
- Streaming events are marked `streaming` and receive no sequence number.
- State events are retained in a per-Scope replay journal.
- The default journal retains at most 4,096 entries and five minutes of history.
- Disposing and recreating a Scope runtime creates a new epoch.

The Web client tracks the highest observed `{ epoch, seq }` per Scope. Duplicate and older sequence values do not move the watermark. An epoch change requires a full Scope resync.

## Replay and Resync

On reconnect, the client requests:

```text
GET /event/replay?since=<seq>&epoch=<epoch>
```

The route always returns a JSON result:

```ts
{
  status: "ok"
  epoch: string
  seq: number
  events: SequencedEvent[]
}
```

or:

```ts
{
  status: "reset"
  epoch: string
  seq: number
}
```

`reset` is returned when:

- the client's epoch belongs to another runtime;
- the client is ahead of the current sequence;
- the required journal prefix has expired or been pruned.

For `ok`, the frontend applies replayed events through the same event reducer and advances the Scope watermark. For `reset` or request failure, it refetches the aggregated Scope bootstrap snapshot and the independent permission/question collections. Volatile freshness is invalidated for all retained sessions, inactive volatile buckets are cleared, and only the actively viewed session's inbox/todo/DAG state is batch-refetched.

When replay returns `reset`, the frontend also calls `resourceFreshness.resetScope()` before refetching. This advances the Scope generation, invalidates in-flight resource requests, and clears stale per-resource versions so the resync snapshots can establish fresh baselines.

Resources outside the normalized store, including BlueprintLoop feature state, observe `reconnectVersion` and refetch after connection recovery.

Active session message/part snapshots also observe reconnect recovery. Because tool-part updates are published as unsequenced streaming events, reconnect replay alone cannot restore a missed tool card. After a reconnect, `sync.session.sync()` force-reloads the viewed session's durable message/part snapshot in addition to volatile collections.

Reconnect replay starts from the watermark retained before the disconnect. Live gap recovery likewise retains the pre-gap watermark as `replayFrom`; it neither advances the Scope watermark nor applies the triggering event until replay or full resync completes. An epoch change also holds the prior watermark and requires authoritative full resync. Duplicate recovery requests for the same Scope are coalesced while replay is pending.

## Resource-Level Snapshot Freshness

The sync layer applies a freshness gate to DAG, Todo, Inbox, and Message snapshots and live events. Each resource is scoped to `(scopeKey, sessionID, resource)`.

### Response headers

Scoped snapshot responses expose:

- `x-synergy-seq`
- `x-synergy-epoch`

This includes ordinary scoped GET snapshots and the POST volatile batch response. The server captures the epoch and sequence number before reading the snapshot, so the value is a conservative lower bound for that response. The Web client reads both headers via `readSyncVersion()` and uses them in the freshness checks below.

A response is unversioned when either header is absent or the epoch/sequence values are invalid.

### Request tokens

Every snapshot request captures a `SyncResourceRequest` token:

- `generation` — a Scope-level monotonic counter. A new Scope epoch or `releaseScope` advances the generation, invalidating all in-flight requests for that Scope.
- `revision` — a per-resource counter that increments on every accepted event or snapshot and on local invalidation. A revision mismatch means the resource was written between request capture and response arrival.

### Response acceptance

`acceptResponse()` checks the captured request before delegating every accepted response to `acceptSnapshot()`:

1. **Generation match.** If the current Scope generation differs from the request generation, the response is rejected — a Scope epoch switch or release occurred between request and response.

1. **Revision check.** If the resource revision changed while the request was in flight, an unversioned response is rejected. A versioned response may continue only when the resource has a known current version to compare against.

1. **Snapshot version guard.** Responses that pass the request-token checks still go through the epoch and sequence checks below.

### Local invalidation

Optimistic message insertion/removal, authoritative part checkpoints/removals for messages present in the loaded window, and history prepends call `invalidate()` for the session's `message` resource. Invalidation clears the stored resource version and advances its revision without changing the Scope epoch. Requests captured before that local write are therefore rejected, including versioned responses, because no current resource version remains to prove that they include the local mutation.

Streaming `message.part.delta` frames do not invalidate resource freshness. They remain unsequenced, append-only projections whose next full checkpoint converges authoritative part state.

Message-page requests also capture a local per-message part revision map. Applied delta, checkpoint, and removal events advance only the affected message revision. A mutation applied to an existing local bucket makes an otherwise accepted snapshot preserve that live bucket. A checkpoint or removal ignored because its parent message is outside the loaded window marks that message as requiring a newer snapshot; an in-flight page retries only when its returned effective window contains the affected message, so unrelated orphan events do not supersede the whole session page. Scope release and message-bucket eviction retire these local request tokens.

### Snapshot version guard

`acceptSnapshot()` enforces:

- **Retired epochs are rejected.** An epoch that has been superseded cannot overwrite current state.
- **Snapshots cannot switch an established Scope epoch.** `prepareSnapshotScope()` rejects a snapshot whose epoch differs from the current Scope epoch when one exists. Events are authoritative for epoch transitions; a snapshot may establish only the initial epoch when no Scope version has been set.
- **Older snapshots are rejected.** A snapshot with `seq < current.seq` for the same resource and epoch is stale and discarded. Equal `seq` is accepted because the server stamps the sequence before reading.
- **Unversioned responses fail open conditionally.** An unversioned response is accepted when no intervening same-resource write occurred (revision unchanged). When an event updated the resource in flight, the response is rejected because it cannot prove it is newer. An accepted unversioned snapshot clears the stored resource version, so later ordering starts from the next valid version.

### Scope-level event pre-filter

Before any event reaches `applyEvent()`, the global listener calls `acceptScopeEvent(scopeKey, version)`. This applies to every incoming event, not only resource-gated updates:

- events from retired epochs are dropped without changing the watermark or triggering replay;
- an event from a new epoch retires the old epoch, advances the Scope generation, invalidates in-flight resource requests, clears per-resource versions, and establishes the new epoch floor;
- unversioned events, including streaming deltas, pass through without changing Scope freshness state.

This pre-filter runs before watermark observation and before the resource-specific `acceptEvent()` checks.

### Event acceptance

Live events (`todo.updated`, `dag.updated`, `session.inbox.updated`, `message.updated`, and `message.removed`) pass through `acceptEvent()` for their owning resource:

- **Epoch advance.** An event with a new epoch retires the old epoch, advances the Scope generation (invalidating in-flight snapshot requests), clears all resource versions for that Scope, and establishes the new epoch.
- **Ordered only.** Within the same epoch, an event with `seq <= current.seq` for that resource is a duplicate and discarded.
- **Unversioned events** clear the resource version rather than preserving a comparison that can no longer be proven. A later unversioned snapshot may still fail open when its request was captured after that event and no same-resource write occurred in flight.
- Every accepted event bumps the resource revision.

### Resource scope

Per-resource snapshot/event ordering applies to `dag`, `todo`, `inbox`, and `message`. Message replacement snapshots include latest page loads, background prefetches, and post-compaction page loads. Message part checkpoints/removals for messages present in the loaded window and local optimistic writes invalidate concurrent message requests without becoming sequenced resource events; streaming deltas remain outside resource freshness. Part mutations outside the loaded window use the per-message freshness decision above instead of globally invalidating unrelated pages. All incoming events still pass through the Scope-level epoch pre-filter.

## Streaming Delta Protocol

The in-process Bus publishes a full `message.part.updated` object for every text/reasoning increment. The client wire encoder rewrites that stream for clients that opt into `stream=delta`.

For each streaming part, the wire sends:

- a full `message.part.updated` checkpoint for the first increment;
- compact `message.part.delta` frames between checkpoints;
- another full checkpoint at most once per second;
- a full terminal update when streaming ends.

A checkpoint and delta are mutually exclusive for one increment, preventing double append.

Streaming frames remain unsequenced because they are convergent rather than journaled state. If a delta arrives before its part exists locally, the frontend ignores it; the next full checkpoint creates or corrects the authoritative part.

Encoder checkpoint state is transport-local. The global WebSocket delta clients share one encoder because they receive the same frames; each SSE connection owns another encoder. A global encoder shared across independent transports would let one consumer's checkpoint timing corrupt another's convergence.

### Incremental presentation

The reconciled `part.text` string remains the authoritative frontend snapshot. Active text and reasoning renderers keep an offset into that snapshot and pass only the appended suffix through the display projection and the streaming Markdown parser. They do not compare, transform, or replay the accumulated prefix on each update, and they do not create a separate character-rate backlog between the event stream and the renderer.

The display projection preserves trim and project-path relativization across chunk boundaries. A part identity change, source shrink, or transition to terminal state rebuilds from the authoritative snapshot once. Terminal state comes only from the part's explicit end marker or the owning message's completion marker; coarse session status and the presence of a later timeline part do not terminate a renderer that can still receive deltas. The terminal Markdown path then performs the complete Marked, syntax, math, and sanitization render once and replaces the streaming tree. Its optional visual transition is one-shot and interrupt-safe: cancellation collapses the staged terminal tree immediately, and activation does not force a synchronous layout read.

Streaming Markdown creates a fixed set of token elements through DOM APIs and rejects unsafe link and image URL protocols before setting attributes. Raw model HTML is never assigned to `innerHTML` during streaming. Automatic bottom-following is coalesced so content growth schedules at most one scroll operation per animation frame.

## Server Part Write-Behind

Network streaming and disk persistence are separate optimizations.

`PartWriteBuffer` coalesces streaming text/reasoning persistence per part at a default 500 ms interval. It always retains the newest full part value.

- streaming increments defer disk writes;
- discrete tool/status changes write immediately;
- terminal writes cancel or supersede buffered values;
- `messagePage()` flushes pending writes for the requested session before reading its snapshot;
- loop finalization flushes every pending value;
- a turn ending in error or abort republishes each non-empty unfinished text/reasoning part as a full checkpoint before completing the message;
- buffer cancellation is used only when an immediate authoritative write will replace it.

This removes quadratic full-part disk writes while keeping snapshot reads and terminal frontend recovery aligned with the latest streamed content.

## Compaction Attempt Projection

Compaction assistants remain canonically hidden until a non-empty summary commits, but the shared timeline makes one narrow presentation exception: a hidden compaction assistant whose persisted `metadata.compactionAttempt.state` is `running` projects as the running compaction card. Raw streamed compaction text stays suppressed behind that card. The same message ID and timeline key remain mounted when the backend changes the attempt to `committed`, makes the message visible, and adds the recovery part.

The processor's terminal message checkpoint does not end this presentation lifecycle. The compaction owner resolves `running` to `committed`, `failed`, or `empty`; hidden failed and empty attempts therefore disappear instead of remaining as stale progress. Ordinary `visible = false` messages never receive this exception.

## Compaction Swap

`session.compacted` means the visible effective message set changed at a summary boundary.

The compaction event is gated through `acceptEvent()` using both the session's `inbox` and `message` resource keys. A duplicate, older, or retired-epoch compaction event is discarded before any message swap or cleanup runs.

The frontend:

1. captures separate Inbox and Message request tokens, per-message part revisions, and a Context projection revision, then fetches the post-compaction messages via `session.messagePage()` while keeping the current timeline visible;
1. accepts the page through the same bounded-retry Message loader used by ordinary latest-page loads and recomputes the apply plan from the current store when an attempt succeeds;
1. applies one Solid batch that deletes stale parts and diff state, deletes inbox state only if no newer inbox event arrived while the fetch was in flight, and preserves live part buckets changed during the request;
1. reconciles the retained messages, unchanged authoritative parts, message window metadata, and latest Context projection atomically.

Fetch-before-swap prevents an empty timeline flash. Part buckets belonging to messages outside the new effective set must be released. The message window metadata (`nextCursor`, `hasMore`, `total`, `mode`, `pendingLatest`, `pendingLatestIds`) is replaced atomically in the same batch. Newer Message state supersedes and retries the whole stale swap, newer Inbox state preserves only the inbox bucket, newer per-message part state preserves that live bucket, and a newer Context projection revision preserves the newer usage record.

## Message Bucket Eviction

Loaded message and part buckets are memory-bounded independently of session metadata.

- the global LRU spans Scope/session bucket keys;
- at most 15 session buckets are retained;
- the actively viewed session is protected even if it is the oldest;
- eviction removes that session's message array, all parts owned by those messages, the session's `messageWindow` metadata, and its latest Context projection;
- revisiting an evicted session reloads it through normal message page sync.

Session lists, status, inbox, todo, and other non-message state are not evicted by this policy.

## Composer Intent

Composer model selection has strict one-way layering:

1. user draft selection
2. session default: explicit server `modelOverride`, otherwise last root message model
3. global/application fallback

Lower layers never write into higher layers. Selecting a model explicitly persists `modelOverride`; merely resolving a fallback does not mutate the session default or current draft.

Agent and workflow selections follow the same principle: server session fields are durable defaults, while unsent composer intent remains local until the user performs an action that explicitly persists it.

Variant display resolves the explicit or historical session variant first, then the agent default and configured model-role default. Only the session variant is submitted; displaying a configured fallback never writes it into message history.

## Invariants

- One global event WebSocket multiplexes events by owning Scope directory.
- State events are sequenced per Scope epoch; streaming events are unsequenced.
- Replay returns `ok` or `reset` JSON and full resync is the fail-open recovery. Live gaps replay from the retained pre-gap watermark and do not apply the triggering event before recovery.
- Scope bootstrap is one aggregated generated-SDK snapshot plus independent permission/question requests; reconnect eagerly refreshes volatile state only for the viewed session.
- Bounded domain event queues use explicit recovery signals rather than silent loss. For File workspace watcher overflow, `file.watcher.updated` carries `resync: true`, and the File context reloads its root, expanded directories, and active document.
- Every event passes the Scope epoch pre-filter; DAG, Todo, Inbox, and Message additionally use resource-level snapshot/event freshness (generation + revision tokens and version comparison). Optimistic message writes and authoritative part mutations for messages present in the loaded window invalidate concurrent Message requests; streaming deltas do not. Unversioned snapshots are accepted only when no intervening same-resource write occurred.
- Store updates reconcile existing leaves and identities.
- Superseded latest-message snapshots retry before a bucket is marked ready; per-message part decisions apply unchanged buckets, preserve newer live buckets, and retry only pages that contain an ignored out-of-window mutation.
- Streaming deltas converge through periodic checkpoints and a final full checkpoint on normal completion, error, or abort.
- Active text rendering processes appended suffixes rather than rescanning accumulated snapshots.
- Session-scoped snapshot reads flush pending part write-behind first, and disk write-behind never delays discrete or terminal persistence.
- Compaction fetches before swapping the visible message set and uses the same supersession recovery as ordinary latest loads.
- The active session survives message-bucket eviction.
- Composer fallback resolution never writes upward into user intent.
- The frontend message window is a viewport, not the full transcript. `messages()` and `messagePage()` serve different consumers.
- Latest mode keeps the newest messages and evicts oldest; history mode preserves the existing window and caps newest overflow.
- `messageWindow` metadata and messages are evicted together by the message-bucket LRU.
- Latest Context usage is sync-owned and independent of history viewport suppression; authoritative latest pages seed it and bucket eviction removes it.
