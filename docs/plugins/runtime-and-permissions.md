# Plugin Runtime and Capabilities

## Activation and Invocation

Synergy keeps one active runtime generation per plugin. The registry key is `pluginId + version + generation`; multiple enabled Scopes share it. A process starts lazily when an executable contribution is first invoked. `activate()` runs once for that generation and receives only plugin identity, version, generation, and a logger.

Every handler invocation receives a fresh context:

```ts
interface PluginInvocationContext {
  requestId: string
  scopeId: string
  sessionId?: string
  runtime: {
    hostVersion: string
    pluginVersion: string
    pluginGeneration: string
    protocolVersion: number
  }
  actor: PluginActor
  signal: AbortSignal
  log: PluginLogger
  events: ScopedPluginEventPublisher
  session?: SessionHostService
  task?: TaskHostService
  workspace?: WorkspaceHostService
  settings?: PluginSettingsService
  secrets?: PluginSecretsService
  tools?: PluginToolHostService
}
```

The context is request state; do not cache it as a current Scope. `runtime` is read-only provenance identity for the active generation. Runtime startup never receives a raw SDK client, server URL, access token, or Scope/Session identity.

External plugins use `process`. Trusted built-ins may use `inProcess`. The process boundary isolates crashes, timeouts, and cleanup; it is not an OS security sandbox and does not claim to restrict direct filesystem or network access by plugin code.

## Capabilities and Host Services

Capabilities describe Synergy services the host may inject. A contribution's `requires` must be a subset of the definition's top-level capability list.

| Capability        | Context service or action                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `session.read`    | `context.session.get()`                                                             |
| `session.control` | `context.session.abort()`                                                           |
| `workspace.read`  | `context.workspace.read()` and `metadata()`                                         |
| `workspace.write` | `context.workspace.write()`                                                         |
| `task.delegate`   | `context.task.start()`, `current()`, `get()`, and `cancel()`                        |
| `settings.read`   | `context.settings.get()`                                                            |
| `settings.write`  | `context.settings.replace()`                                                        |
| `secrets`         | plugin-scoped credential get/set/delete                                             |
| `tool.invoke`     | `context.tools.invoke()`                                                            |
| `ui.hostActions`  | trusted UI host navigation, panel, resource, notification, and confirmation actions |

`task.delegate` may include `agents` and `maxRuntimeMs` constraints. `start()` resolves the target from Synergy's native Agent registry and launches it through native Cortex; plugins do not own a parallel Agent or task runtime. A plugin's private `hidden` Agent is callable only by the same plugin ID and active generation. Non-owned targets retain ordinary Agent visibility rules. `start()` returns a handle immediately and persists plugin/generation/Scope/correlation ownership on the Cortex child Session before execution begins. `current()` resolves that durable owner from the invocation's child Session and returns it only to the owning plugin generation and Scope; it returns `undefined` outside an owned plugin task. Plugins use the correlation ID for domain binding instead of depending on a post-launch Session attachment. `get()` and `cancel()` enforce the same ownership. Non-agent invocations must provide an explicit parent Session/message in the current Scope; `tool.invoke` remains agent-only.

Host capability approval and runtime permission evaluation are separate gates. For delegated work, the manifest gate is `task.delegate`; the control-profile permission is `task`. Host Service failures preserve a stable optional `code` across process IPC so plugins can make typed recovery decisions.
`context.session.get()` and `context.session.abort()` are limited to Sessions in the invocation Scope. Cross-Scope targets fail with `PLUGIN_SESSION_SCOPE_MISMATCH`; delegated start parents use the separate `PLUGIN_TASK_PARENT_SCOPE_MISMATCH` code.

Approval is derived from generated capabilities and trusted UI. Changing the manifest or capability hash requires approval again. Approval never expands the source declaration.

## Operations

Operations are finite request/response handlers. `type` is `query` or `command`; both input and output are validated against generated JSON Schema. `expose` defaults to `['ui']`. Only operations that include `sdk` may be called through `client.plugin.invoke()`.

The server endpoint is:

```text
POST /plugin/:pluginId/operations/:operationId/invoke
```

The host checks plugin existence, Scope enablement, contribution identity, caller exposure, schemas, timeout, cancellation, and generation. Stable error codes are:

```text
PLUGIN_NOT_FOUND
PLUGIN_DISABLED
PLUGIN_UNAVAILABLE
CONTRIBUTION_NOT_FOUND
INPUT_INVALID
OUTPUT_INVALID
CAPABILITY_DENIED
CONFLICT
TIMEOUT
CANCELLED
RUNTIME_ERROR
```

Long-running domain work returns a plugin-owned handle and reports changes through declared events. Synergy does not create a generic plugin Job or business-data store.

## Events

Declare every publishable event with an ID and payload schema. `context.events.publish()` validates that declaration and payload, then attaches plugin ID/version, generation, Scope, optional Session, sequence, and timestamp. A plugin cannot publish as another plugin or Scope.

Events are for invalidation and small changes. Consumers should re-run a query for a complete snapshot. UI subscriptions are filtered by plugin ID, Scope, and event ID.

## Hooks

Plugins contribute handlers to host-defined hook points. A plugin cannot define execution semantics for a new point.

- `observer` observes and cannot replace the value.
- `transform` returns the next value in a serial chain.
- `guard` returns `{ allow, reason?, value? }`.

Ordering is priority, plugin ID, then contribution ID. Each hook point owns input/output schema, timeout, and failure policy. A handler failure degrades that contribution. It propagates only when the point's failure policy requires it; a guard denial always propagates as a denial.

## Generation Changes and Lifecycle

A new generation starts and validates before it becomes active. The previous generation drains in-flight calls. A late response from an inactive generation is rejected.

`lifecycle.upgrade` runs on the prepared new version before activation. Failure keeps the old version active. Plugin migrations must be idempotent because Synergy cannot roll back arbitrary plugin-owned data changes.

`lifecycle.uninstall` runs before registration, approval, settings, and runtime state are removed. Failure stops normal uninstall. Force uninstall skips the handler and may leave plugin-owned data.

Synergy does not delete or migrate plugin business data. The plugin owns its schema, location, concurrency, backup, upgrade, and cleanup policy.
