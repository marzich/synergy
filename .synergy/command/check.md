Verify the current Synergy changes from narrow checks to repository gates. Interpret `$ARGUMENTS` as a requested scope or additional check.

1. Inspect `git diff --stat` and select the affected package/domain tests.
2. Run the narrow test first. Core runtime tests run from `packages/synergy`.
3. Run the default root preflight:

```bash
bun run quality:quick
```

4. Run `bun run quality` when the change crosses shared abstractions, the user requests the full suite, or the work is ready for PR-level verification.

For core-runtime harness changes or CI-equivalent verification, run `bun run test:ci` from `packages/synergy` after focused tests. This uses sequential fresh-process shards and may replace a redundant second single-process full-suite run when the CI boundary is the intended signal.

5. Add specialized checks when relevant:

```bash
bun run deadcode
bun run workflow:check
bun run secrets:check
bun run desktop:test
```

Frontend changes use the package test entry points before the root gates:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app test
bun run --cwd packages/ui test
```

Theme changes also run `bun run --cwd packages/ui generate:theme` and verify that no generated artifact changes remain after a second generation.

Localization changes update the catalogs and then run the single repository localization gate:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app i18n:extract
bun run localization:check
bun run --cwd packages/app build
```

Extraction must leave no catalog diff. The repository gate repeats extraction, rejects drift, strict-compiles every catalog, and scans App/UI source. Report catalog completeness, ICU compilation, production locale chunking, and any reviewed pass-through allowlist entries.

Do not use root `bun test`; it intentionally fails. Do not bypass hooks or weaken tests. Report each command, pass/fail counts, causal failure, fixes made, rerun result, and checks not run.
